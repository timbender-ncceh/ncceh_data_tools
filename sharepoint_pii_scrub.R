## WARNING - PLEASE READ ##
## --------------------- ##

# THIS SCRIPT DELETES FILES PERMANENTLY. THERE IS ALWAYS A NON-ZERO RISK THAT
# IMPORTANT FILES MAY BE DELETED INADVERTENTLY WHEN A SCRIPT IS WRITTEN FOR THIS
# PURPOSE.

# DO NOT ASSUME THIS FILE HAS BEEN TESTED OR IS SAFE, OR DOES WHAT YOU THINK
# IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO

# DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES. 


## OVERVIEW - PLEASE READ ##
## ---------------------- ##

# THIS SCRIPT IS DESIGNED TO SEARCH THROUGH A SPECIFIED FILE DIRECTORY AND ALL
# SUB-DIRECTORIES THAT IT CONTAINS FOR FILES WITH FILENAMES MATCHING A SPECIFIC
# VALUE.  WHEN A MATCHING FILE IS FOUND, THE SCRIPT WILL USE THE WINDOWS
# OPERATING SYSTEM TO FIRST OVERWRITE THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
# (PII) WITHIN THE FILE WITH NULL VALUES, SAVE THE CHANGES TO THE FILE, THEN
# PERMANENTLY REMOVE THE FILE FROM THE DIRECTORY.

## POTENTIAL ISSUES ##
## ---------------- ##

# THE CODE WILL SEARCH FOR ALL FILES NAMED "Client.csv" WHICH IS WHERE WE KNOW
# PII DATA IS LOCATED IN HMIS EXPORTS.

# ISSUE #1: FALSE POSITIVES: ANY FILES SAVED IN THE DIRECTORY NAMED "Client.csv"
# WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR WHAT THE FILE CONTAINS.
# THEORETICALLY THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY FILES WITH THE SAME NAME THAT ARE NOT A
# PRODUCT OF THE HMIS_CSV EXPORT PROCESS.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE
# THAT SOMEONE HAS UNKNOWINGLY NAMED AN IMPORTANT, UNRELATED FILE "Client.csv"
# AND THIS SCRIPT WILL PERMANENTLY DELETE IT.

# ISSUE #2: FALSE NEGATIVES: ANYONE COULD CIRCUMVENT THE SECURITY MEASURES
# AFFORDED BY THIS LOGIC BY SIMPLY RENAMING THE "Client.csv" FILE TO SOME OTHER
# NAME SUCH AS "new_client.csv". THIS FILE WOULD NOT BE FOUND BY THIS SCRIPT,
# AND THUS PII WOULD REMAIN ON IN THE DIRECTORY.

# ISSUES #1 AND #2 CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH A REASONABLE LEVEL OF CERTAINITY BY
# ADDING ADDITIONAL LOGIC TO THIS CODE, BUT WE INTEND THIS TO BE A QUICK
# IMPLEMENTATION THAT CAN ALSO BE EASY TO READ AND COMPREHEND BY THE AUTHOR AND
# NON-AUTHORS ALIKE.  COMPLEXITY IS NOT A GOOD THING WHEN IT COMES TO FILE
# MANAGEMENT.
